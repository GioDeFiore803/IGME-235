    <h2>Well what is Balatro?</h2>
    <p>
        Balatro is a strategic card game with a roguelike structure influenced by the Cantonese card game Big Two and Luck be a Landlord. <br>
        A game is played as a run that is different every time because of various parameters and random elements. It is up to the player to <br>
        organize and enhance a standard deck of 52 cards to complete the run, which ends the game. During runs various elements are unlocked <br>
        permanently, but as is typical for a roguelike, most of the items and progress are lost as soon as the run is over, whether it was completed <br>
        successfully or not. A run is divided into multiple steps called Blinds with a limited number of hands. If a Blind cannot be completed <br>
        because the requirements are not met, the game is over right away.

    <h2>Reviews</h2>
    <h3><em>Review from Video Games Chronicle</em></h3>
    <blockquote>
        Balatro is an astonishingly addictive take on Poker that's utterly impossible to put down. Occasional <br>
        difficulty spikes aside, it's a piece of simplistic genius that we'll keep on our Steam Deck forever.
    </blockquote>

    <h3><em>Review from Pocket Gamer UK</em></h3>
    <blockquote>
        Balatro is a great card game for beginners and veterans of the genre alike. At a cool $9.99 with hundreds <br>
        of unique Jokers and other cards to collect, dozens of challenging runs to complete and further challenges, <br>
        this is one of those rare forever games that's more than worth picking up.
